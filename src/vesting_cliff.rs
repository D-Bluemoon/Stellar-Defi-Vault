//! Reward vesting cliff (issue #287).
//!
//! A cliff blocks reward *accrual* entirely until a position has been staked
//! for a configurable minimum duration. Once the cliff is reached, rewards
//! unlock all at once and accrue **retroactively from `staked_at_ledger`**, not
//! from the cliff date â€” so the first claim after the cliff pays out
//! `cliff_ledgers` worth of rewards.
//!
//! This is distinct from the two neighbouring features it is easy to confuse
//! it with:
//!
//! * Issue #35's vesting schedule releases rewards that have *already been
//!   claimed* on a drip. This one decides whether rewards exist at all.
//! * Issue #201's anti-sybil minimum stake age gates *claiming*. This one
//!   gates *accrual*, so a position inside the cliff reports zero pending.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! `DataKey` sits at Soroban's 50-variant cap for `#[contracttype]` enums, so
//! this module uses raw `Symbol`-keyed storage, matching the pattern already
//! established in `balance.rs`.
